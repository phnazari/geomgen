# The Geometry of Generalization

This project is part of my [Master's Thesis](https://phnazari.github.io/assets/pdf/Master_Thesis.pdf) at ETH Zurich, conducted in the lab of Prof. BÃ¶lcskei. The thesis explores the geometry of generalization in neural networks.

## Recreating Experiments

To recreate the experiments described in the thesis, follow these steps:

1. **Setup the Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required packages in requirements.txt

2. **Running Experiments**
   - The experiments can be run using the `experiments.py` script.
   - For example, to run the sawtooth network experiments, use:
     ```bash
     python experiments.py
     ```
   - You can specify parameters such as the number of layers (L) and repetitions (R) directly in the script or modify the function calls in `experiments.py`.

3. **Viewing Results**
   - Results are saved as plots on the Desktop.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the comments within the `experiments.py` file.
